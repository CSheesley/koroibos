### Project Description
This is the final solo project for the Backend program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The goal is to treat this like a 48 hour take home [Code Challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module4/projects/take_home_challenge/prompts/olympic_spec.md) that one may receive during the interview process. We were given free choice of which language to use, and what we want to highlight when we present our work.

### Local Set-up
`$ bundle install`  
`$ rails db:create`  
`$ rails db:migrate`  
`rake task info to come - importing CSV data`  

### Key Learnings
